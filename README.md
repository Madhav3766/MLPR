This project addresses the challenge of predicting the best fantasy cricket team compositions for the Indian Premier League (IPL) using historical player performance data. Previous studies have employed various machine learning approaches for team selection, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, & ExtraTrees Regressor. Our approach differs by integrating a truth value algorithm that accounts not only for the various features of the players but also the DREAM11 scores of all players across the history of IPL i.e. from 2008 to 2024.

We have collected ball-by-ball data for all IPL matches through cricsheet.org, an open-source dataset for all international & league cricket matches. This has helped ensure a robust foundation for analysis. Other than cleaning the data for usage, we employed Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality and tackle multicollinearity among variables.

We’ve decided to perform Logistic Regression & Time Series Prediction using LSTM. Our current log loss using logistic regression is 0.68. Our accuracy with LSTM was 50.09%. We’ve decided to use 'error-rate' as our performance metric. This will be a comparison between the team our algorithm predicts, and the Dream Team released by DREAM11 post every match.
